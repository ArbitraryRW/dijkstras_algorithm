# Dsijkstra's Algorithm

### Background

A basic implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm. 

This is a graph search algorithm that solves single-source shortest path problems for graphs with non-negative edge path weights, producing a shortest path tree. 

Concieved by Edsger Dijkstra.

### Implementation 
Solves a basic three point static graph.
